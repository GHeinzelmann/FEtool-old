# FEtool.py

FEtool.py is a python tool for fully automated absolute binding free energy calculations. It encompasses the creation of the system, generation of parameters, preparation of the simulation files, and analysing the simulations to retrieve the binding free energy. 

It is able to perform the calculations through a physical route, using the attach-pull-release (APR) method, as well as an alchemical route, using a double decoupling (DD) procedure in the presence of restraints. The program is compatible with AMBER18 (both DD and APR), as well as AMBER16 (APR only). It also requires a few installed programs such as VMD, which are explained in detail below.
